Physlumina is an OpenGL-based real-time raymarching engine inspired by Blender's rendering techniques. It allows users to create and manipulate 3D environments, add objects, and adjust their material properties in real-time, incorporating physics simulations for enhanced realism.

### Features:

- Real-Time Raymarching: Experience dynamic rendering with real-time raymarching capabilities.

- Object-Oriented Design: Utilize classes such as buffer objects for efficient data handling, vertex objects for precise polygon rendering, and variable handlers for dynamic adjustments.

- Physics Integration: Apply physics simulations to objects for realistic interactions within the 3D environment.

### Getting Started:

1. Clone the Repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Bozmoss/Physlumina.git
```

2. Build the Project:

- Open the CourseWork.sln solution file in your preferred IDE, will work best in Visual Studio.

- Build the solution to compile the engine.

3. Run the Application:

- Execute the compiled application to launch the 3D environment.

### Downloading:

- Download the latest x64 release from the tags section. You want the zip file that begins with `vx.y.z`.
- x86 is not currently supported.

### Usage:

- Adding Objects:

Use the interface to insert new 3D objects into the scene.
- Modifying Material Properties:

Adjust material attributes such as color, reflectivity, and texture in real-time.
- Applying Physics:

Enable physics simulations to observe realistic object interactions.
